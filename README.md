# First approach of a recommendation syst√®me using K Nearest Neighbors algorithm and spotify API
  
This project aims to predict 10 new tracks that could be added to a given playlist, using spotify datas.

## Built with
- [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)  
- [Scikit-learn KNeighborsClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)  
- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/)
- [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

## Getting started
### Prerequisite
- Getting a spotify developper account that allows to access to a client secret.  
- Creating a .env file with variables ```client_id```, ```client_id```, and ```token``` (generated by spotify api).

### Installation
Clone the repository :

  ```sh 
  git clone https://github.com/Twizzle1997/spotify_perso
  ```
    
Install the requirements : 
  ```sh 
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
    
## Get your recommendations
- Run [src/notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/Twizzle1997/spotify_perso/blob/master/src/notebook.ipynb) to get your personal spotify datas from the API and create the database.   
- You will be able to use the ```knnRecommandation_best_params(playlist_id)``` function that will find the best parameters, predict your 10 best recommendations and set them into your database.
